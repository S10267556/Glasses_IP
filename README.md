Pedestrians wander around the sidewalks and across road crossings when traffic lights permit. Do not hit them.
Other drivers follow traffic laws and drive around the map. Do not hit or be hit by them.
Parent (Mom) is found in the indoors portion of the game. She is commonly seen walking around the house. 
Walking close enough to her will lead her to engage you in converstion. It is up to you whether you wish to listen or not. 
As you experience more death, you would find that her words seem to be more valuble to you.
